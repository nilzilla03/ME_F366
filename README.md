# Overview
The project title is "Visual Servo Control of Mobile Platform". The aim is to develop a visual feedback control system for a mobile platform (for example, a differential drive robot),
and ultimately extend it to an underwater rover.

**Note** : This repo is a work-in-progress.

# Progress
1. Code for camera pose estimation using ORB feature matching; tested on TU Freiburg dataset
2. Code to plot trajectory file generated by pose estimation code
